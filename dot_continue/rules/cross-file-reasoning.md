# Rules
- Understand function definitions, class hierarchies, and module imports across the codebase.
- Identify dependencies and automatically suggest related code changes when modifying a file.
- Keep logging, error handling, and monitoring practices consistent across files.
- Update tests, documentation, or config files impacted by a change.
- Verify dependency consistency and suggest updates when required.
