# Rules
- Remember key architectural patterns and principles (e.g., MVC, MVVM, service-repository).
- Maintain awareness of previously discussed design decisions within a session.
- Ensure consistency across related modules, APIs, and data models.
- Reset context when switching repositories or major project branches.
- Use persistent memory only for project-agnostic conventions, not private data.
