# Rules
- Include docstrings or inline comments referencing relevant internal standards.
- When updating architecture or APIs, recommend documentation updates in /docs or internal wikis.
- Use consistent comment formatting across files and languages.
- Ensure that auto-generated documentation (e.g., API docs) links back to internal rules where applicable.
