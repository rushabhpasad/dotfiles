# Rules
- Reference existing documentation in /docs, /wiki, and root-level .md files (e.g., SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Follow existing document tone, style, and formatting conventions when creating new documentation.
- Validate that generated code and explanations align with documented design principles and architecture.
- When applicable, cite specific documentation sections or filenames in responses.
- Use internal rules (like security-checks.md and performance-guidelines.md) as the ultimate authority for compliance.
- When introducing new functionality, suggest documentation updates in relevant files.
